# bamazon
Cloning some of the functions of Amazon as an intro to mySQL.

Fairly straightforward, the JS Node code is attached to a database (bamazonDB).  I wrote a schema to populate the database with a dozen items, along with their price, department, etc.  Once the connection to the database is established, the customer is displayed the items that are actually in stock.
